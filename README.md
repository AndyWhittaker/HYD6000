<p>This is a very badly written Python Script to Request and Read Data from the HYD6000 Inverter RS485 Port and Write To EmonCMS (or EmonPi).</p>
<p>Since we require the script to be called at regular intervals, I have also included a very simple Node-RED script to call the Python code (currently) at 30 second intervals.</p>

<p>We require to interface between the Raspberry Pi and the Sofar HYD6000 inverter via RS485. On the bottom of the HYD6000 you can find the interface connections.</p>

<p>The CAN/485m connection goes off to the batteries. However, the next interface available is the RS485s connection, Sofar even gives you the correct connector to plug-in (it looks to me like a Phoenix/ Weidm√ºller Type).</p>
<p>We now need a cheap USB to RS485 (which is a two wire interface) to allow us to connect to our Raspberry Pi. Note RS485 is completely different from RS232, do not attempt to use the wrong interface. log-on to eBay and search for RS422 interfaces and you will have one in your possession within a few days. If you would like to read up about the differences between RS232, RS422 and RS485, please have a short Google search for them. RS422 and RS485 are similar, just full-duplex verses half-duplex.</p>

<p>Link the interface up with the inverter with a length of CAT5 pair of wire. Be sure to match-up the + and - connections on either end. In my case, TX- connects to D- and TX+ connects to D+.</p>

<p>Plug the USB RS485 interface into a spare USB port and reboot the Pi. SSH back in and type</p>
